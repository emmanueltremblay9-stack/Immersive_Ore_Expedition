# IOE Worldgen Registration Scaffold

Province System v7 adds a scaffold for future runtime worldgen registration in the consolidated module. The scaffold centralizes:

- stable IOE worldgen feature keys under the `immersive_ore_expedition` namespace;
- a bootstrap entrypoint for future configured feature, placed feature, and biome modifier wiring;
- runtime placement gates that keep placement no-op by default.

This is architecture only. It does not register placed features, configured features, biome modifiers, structure templates, blocks, items, entities, ores, gems, fluids, datapacks, mixins, access transformers, or dependencies.

Runtime behavior remains default-off. Future placement systems can use `IoeWorldgenBootstrap`, `IoeWorldgenRegistration`, `IoeWorldgenFeatureKeys`, and `IoeWorldgenPlacementGates` to plug in safely, but v7 does not place ore chambers, anchors, IE/IP clues, crystal growth sites, Nether geodes, or retrogen mutations.

Existing Province System behavior is unchanged: `worldgen.provinces.runtimeIntegrationEnabled` still defaults to `false`, `worldgen.provinces.resourcePolicyRules` still defaults to `[]`, strict resource exclusions still win, diagnostics remain opt-in, and old split IOE namespaces remain legacy opt-in references only.

Validation for this project remains GitHub Actions on the consolidated NeoForge module. Local Gradle, tests, builds, Minecraft, PrismLauncher, smoke tests, and local CI simulation are disabled by default unless explicitly requested.
